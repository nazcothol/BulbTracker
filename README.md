# Welcome to BulbTracker

*A web app by Scott Newton*

## Definition of my Audience
Users of BulbTracker will be people who are interested in getting into smart home technology.
BulbTracker will help them get started with smart light bulbs.

## Mission Statement
I want to create a web application that allows users to get the most out of using smart light bulbs, 
and feel smart about their implementation.

## Elevator Pitch
Whether you're talking about the Internet of things or smart home technology or home automation, 
there are a lot of really neat and new things that we can use to make our environments *smarter*. BulbTracker.com is a web app that guides users towards smart implementation of smart light bulb products. It takes out the guesswork in a confusing market of products and services, and flips the switch from "maybe this is is a good idea" to "I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I can do this." 

__**Strengths of the web app**__
* Simple account creation
  * Allows retrieval of data
  * Allows insights such as energy savings, equipment recommendations
  * Allows aggregated global insights such as specific bulb life, popularity
* Applies principles of ES2015+
* Feeds remote data from a RESTful JSON API
* State-driven, modular Single Page Application is lightweight and fast
